              Nadella on his first day as CEO of Microsoft, with former CEOs Bill Gates (left) and Steve Ballmer (right)
              At Microsoft, Nadella has led major projects that included the company's move to cloud computing and the
              development of one of the largest cloud infrastructures in the world.

              Nadella worked as the senior vice-president of research and development (R&D) for the Online Services
              Division and vice-president of the Microsoft Business Division. Later, he was made the president of
              Microsoft's $19 billion Server and Tools Business and led a transformation of the company's business and
              technology culture from client services to cloud infrastructure and services. He has been credited for
              helping bring Microsoft's database, Windows Server and developer tools to its Azure cloud. The revenue
              from Cloud Services grew to $20.3 billion in June 2013 from $16.6 billion when he took over in 2011. He
              received $84.5 million in 2016 pay.

              In 2013, Nadella's base salary was reportedly $669,167. Including stock bonuses, the total compensation
              stood at around $7.6 million.

              Previous positions held by Nadella include:

              President of the Server & Tools Division (9 February 2011 – February 2014)
              Senior Vice-president of Research and Development for the Online Services Division (March 2007 – February
              2011)
              Vice-president of the Business Division
              Corporate Vice-president of Business Solutions and Search & Advertising Platform Group
              Executive Vice-president of Cloud and Enterprise group

              As CEO (2014–)
              On 4 February 2014, Nadella was announced as the new CEO of Microsoft, the third CEO in the company's
              history, following Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer.

              In October 2014, Nadella attended an event on Women in Computing and courted controversy after he made a
              statement that women should not ask for a raise and should trust the system. Nadella was criticised for
              the statement and he later apologized on Twitter. He then sent an email to Microsoft employees admitting
              he was "Completely wrong."


              Nadella leads a live discussion on Microsoft's cloud strategy in 2014 in San Francisco.
              Nadella's tenure at Microsoft has emphasized working with companies and technologies with which Microsoft
              also competes, including Apple Inc., Salesforce, IBM, and Dropbox. In contrast to previous Microsoft
              campaigns against the Linux operating system, Nadella proclaimed that "Microsoft ❤️ Linux", and Microsoft
              joined the Linux Foundation as a Platinum member in 2016.

              Under Nadella, Microsoft revised its mission statement to "empower every person and every organization on
              the planet to achieve more". He orchestrated a cultural shift at Microsoft by emphasizing empathy,
              collaboration, and 'growth mindset'. He has transformed Microsoft's corporate culture into one that
              emphasizes continual learning and growth.

              In 2014, Nadella's first acquisition with Microsoft was of Mojang, a Swedish game company best known for
              the computer game Minecraft, for $2.5 billion. He followed that by purchasing Xamarin for an undisclosed
              amount. He oversaw the purchase of professional network LinkedIn in 2016 for $26.2 billion. On October 26,
              2018, Microsoft acquired GitHub for US$7.5 billion.

              Since Nadella became CEO, Microsoft stock had tripled by September 2018 with a 27% annual growth rate.</p>
